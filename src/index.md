I'm Daniel, a front-end developer, UX enthusiast and volunteer coach at [Codebar Helsinki](https://www.codebar.io/helsinki).

A Brit happily stranded in Helsinki, I am yet to become Finn-fluent in ice skating.

## Current projects (works in progress)

### Phrase Learner

Phrase Learner is the latest iteration of the language-learning app I've built using various JavaScript frameworks. This iteration uses [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
