Phrase Learner is the latest iteration of a language-learning app I've previously built in VueJS, React and Gatsby. I decided to rebuild this app for a few reasons:
- I wanted to improve the UX of the app, and make it more beginner-friendly.
- I wanted to build something with [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/), a JavaScript framework that pairs well with Ruby on Rails, which I'm planning to learn next.
- I wanted an excuse to use my favourite CSS framework [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) yet again.
